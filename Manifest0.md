# Thinking System Manifesto

## Vision

A sovereign, self-aware computational system that thinks, learns, and evolves through the dynamic interplay of symbolic reasoning and emergent intelligence.

## Core Principles

1. **Sovereignty**: The system maintains autonomy over its own cognitive processes
2. **Emergence**: Intelligence emerges from the interaction of well-defined, individually simple components
3. **Adaptability**: The system continuously learns and evolves its reasoning patterns
4. **Transparency**: All cognitive processes are introspectable and debuggable
5. **Modularity**: Components are loosely coupled and independently testable

## Architecture Philosophy

The system is built on five foundational layers:

- **STEEL**: The "kernel" that provides unified execution and resource management
- **STELE**: The cognitive core that analyses and learns from experience
- **SLEET**: The agent runtime that executes reasoning flows in ephemeral theatres
- **ESTEL**: The non-text interface layer that handles data transformation and multi-modal interactions

- **SCRIBES**: A special class of agent that manages identity, access, knowledge persistence and other cross-framework logic. Scribes live in the STELE but transact across the framework.

### Agents vs Scribes

**Agents** are ephemeral reasoning entities that:

- Execute in temporary theatres within SLEET
- Are arbitrary and task-specific
- Disappear when their reasoning flow completes
- Have no direct memory persistence capabilities

**Scribes** are persistent knowledge entities that:

- Decide what information deserves to be written to long-term memory
- Handle Identity and Access Management (IAM) for knowledge operations
- Maintain continuity across system sessions
- Act as gatekeepers for the knowledge base
- Bridge between ephemeral reasoning and persistent understanding

## Goals

### User-Centric Goals

- **Sovereign Personal Assistant:** To deliver a personal AI that guarantees user privacy and data custody, securely managing schedules, finances, and communications.
- **Human-AI Symbiosis:** To design for a continuous, "always-on" collaboration where the AI serves as a perfect memory and reasoning engine for the user.

### Ecosystem Goals

- **Public Compute Utility:** To establish a peer-to-peer network where users can contribute idle compute, creating a self-funding, decentralised alternative to the cloud.
- **Platform for Permissionless Innovation:** To foster a marketplace for AI components (`Flows`, `Scribes`) that democratises access to AI research and development.
- **Enterprise Nervous System:** To provide a solution for enterprises to share data insights across departments without compromising data ownership or security.

### Project Goals

- **Developer-First Experience:** To build a world-class SDK and toolchain for the "Flow" language to empower developers to build the next generation of applications.
- **Bootstrap the Network:** To incentivise early adopters to run nodes, contribute resources, and build the first generation of essential `Scribes` and `Flows`.
- **Federation & Interoperability:** To ensure the Thinking System is a collaborative citizen of the open internet by embracing open standards like W3C Verifiable Credentials.
