# Contributing (Temporarily Limited)

> Status: The project is still consolidating core architectural invariants across primary crates (STEEL, STELE, SLEET, SCRIBES/ESTEL). External feature / code contributions are **not yet open**.
>
> A highly automated contribution & review pipeline (covering lint, security, architectural conformance, gap tracking) will be introduced shortly. Until that is live:
>
> Allowed now (lightweight only):
>
> - Filing focused issues: bug reports, clarifying questions, documentation errata.
> - Very small documentation corrections (typos / factual fixes) â€” subject to maintainer discretion.
>
> Not accepted yet:
>
> - New features, refactors, API changes, performance rewrites.
> - Large documentation restructures.
>
> Rationale:
>
> - Prevent churn while stabilising internal module boundaries.
> - Prepare automated gates (style, security, determinism, reproducibility) before accepting code.
>
> Next Steps (Maintainer Roadmap):
>
> - Publish automated contribution pipeline & bot-assisted PR template.
> - Open clearly labelled "good first issue" set once invariants freeze.
> - Provide machine-verifiable specification fragments for critical subsystems.
>
> If you have a strategic proposal, open an issue prefixed `proposal:` with a concise abstract; detailed design docs are premature before the automation lands.
>
> Thank you for your interest. Please watch the repository for the announcement enabling structured contributions.
